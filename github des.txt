Hereâ€™s an even more concise version:

### Configure Static Website Hosting on AWS S3

1. **Create S3 Bucket:**

2. **Enable Public Access:**
   - Go to the "Permissions" tab.
   - Deselect "Block all public access" and save.
   - Attach this bucket policy (replace `devbuck123` with your bucket name):
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "devbuck123",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": [
             "arn:aws:s3:::devbuck123/*",
             "arn:aws:s3:::devbuck123"
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Enable Static Website Hosting:**
   - Go to "Properties," enable "Static website hosting."
   - Set `index.html` as the index document, optionally set `error.html`.
   - Save changes.

4. **Upload Files:**
   - Upload website files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`).
   - Make them public.

5. **Make Objects Public:**
   - Select all files, go to "Actions" > "Make Public."

6. **Test Website:**
   - Grab the website URL from "Static website hosting" and open it in a browser.

This is a compact summary of the process!
