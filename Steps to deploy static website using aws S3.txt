Step 1: Make an S3 Bucket
    1. Open AWS Management Console: Locate and access the S3 service from the AWS Management Console.
    2. Create a Bucket:
    • Click the "Create bucket"
    • Enter a distinctive name for the bucket eg, devbuck123.
◦ Choose the area in which you would like your bucket to be located. 
        ◦ Everything else leave default for now so block public access will actually get overridden anyway. 
        ◦ Click "Create bucket".
Step 2: Enable Public Access

1. Edit Block Public Access Settings:
        ◦ In S3 bucket settings, select "Permissions".
        ◦ Under "Block Public Access (bucket settings)", click on "Edit".
        ◦ Deselect "Block all public access" and save your changes.
2. Attach a Bucket Policy:
        ◦ Under the Permissions tab scroll down to Bucket Policy
        ◦ Paste this bucket policy with the modified bucket name of mybucky123 where applicable.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
"Sid": "devbuck123",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": [
"arn:aws:s3:::devbuck123/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::devbuck123"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
        ◦ Save the policy.
Step 3: Set Up Bucket for Static Website Hosting

    1. Go to the "Properties" Tab:
        ◦ Scroll to the "Static website hosting" section.
        ◦ Click "Enable" static website hosting.
        ◦ Set Index document to index.html.
◦ Set Error document as error.html (optional).
        ◦ Save changes.
Step 4: Upload Website Files

    1. Prepare Your Website Files:
        ◦ Create an index.html file for the College Admission form.
◦ Optionally, create other resources such as style.css, script.js, or images. 
    2. Upload Files to the Bucket:
        ◦ Go to the "Objects" tab. 
        ◦ Click "Upload", select your files, and upload them.
◦ All uploaded files must be public.
Step 5: Make Objects Public

    1. Give Files Public Access
        ◦ Select all the uploaded files
        ◦ Click on "Actions" > "Make public" if necessary, depending on permissions.
Because we've attached a bucket policy, the objects should be already public. 
Step 6: Test the Website

    1. Get the URL of the Website:
        ◦ In the section on "Static website hosting", look for the Endpoint URL, like http://mybucky123.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. 
    2. Go to the Website:
◦ Enter this URL into a web browser to see your static web site.
